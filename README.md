- Strengthen your proficiency in at least one programming language, such as Java, Python, C++, or C#.
- Develop a deep understanding of fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues) and their operations.

### 2. Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms:

- Study more advanced data structures (hash maps, heaps, tries, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms).
- Solve algorithmic challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces to enhance your problem-solving skills.

### 3. System Design and Architecture:

- Learn about system design principles, scalability, performance optimization, and trade-offs.
- Practice designing scalable systems for real-world scenarios, considering factors like data storage, load balancing, caching, and databases.

### 4. Object-Oriented Design (OOD):

- Deepen your knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and design patterns.
- Apply design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, and others to write clean and maintainable code.

### 5. Databases and SQL:

- Gain proficiency in working with relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and learn about normalization, indexing, and query optimization.
- Understand NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis) and their use cases.

### 6. Web Development:
